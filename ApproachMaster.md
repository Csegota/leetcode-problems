* Write down known global variables
* Identify type? DP, Matrix, OOP, graph traversal BFS, DFS, string manipulation.
* Come up with representation for the problem?
* Get something running.
* Simplify problem to more simple forms before moving on to more advanced. e.g. maybe it helps to first solve with a sorted array, instead of the unsorted on given.
